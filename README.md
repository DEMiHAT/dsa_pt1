# Array Programs in C

This repository contains basic array manipulation programs written in the C programming language. These programs demonstrate fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, reversing, and merging arrays.

## Files

- **arrays5.c**  
  Inserts an element at any given position in the array.

- **arrays4.c**  
  Deletes all occurrences of a specified element from the array.

- **arrays3.c**  
  Reverses the array in-place using a two-pointer method.

- **arrays2.c**  
  Merges two already sorted arrays into a new sorted array.

- **arrays1.c**  
  Demonstrates both insertion and deletion using reusable functions.

## Compilation & Execution

To compile and run any file using GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
